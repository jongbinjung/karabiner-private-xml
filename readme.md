private.xml for Karabiner on OS X
=====
This is my personal private.xml setting that I use with Karabiner. It includes
Vi navigation bindings, along with a Tab-initiated Numpad configuration.

This is used for syncronization of typing experience accross multiple platforms,
namely Windows and OS X. The key bindings are implemented in Windows using
AutoHotKey_L scirpts.

The AutoHotKey_L scripts can also be found in my github repos. See,

- [ahk-vim-navigation](https://github.com/olorin86/ahk-vim-navigation) repo for
vi navigation binding scripts, and
- [numpad](https://github.com/olorin86/numpad) repo for the numpad scripts
